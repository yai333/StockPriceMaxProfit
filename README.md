## Scenario

The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 10:00am local time.
The values are the price in dollars of the Latitude Financial stock at that time.
So if the stock cost \$5 at 11:00am, stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 5.
Write an efficient function that takes an array of stock prices and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Latitude Financial stock yesterday.

### Stack
